 _With the help of a RaspberryPi you can make your Audio Hi-FI System Smart!_

## Disclaimer
This Repo was for my final high school project, it's just a prototype, unusable outside of my system.
Don't try to download and run any of this code please!
This project is abbandoned and will remain on my GitHub Account just to remember me how bad i coded this stuff, thanks for your attention!

## Description
This project was born to help people with old Hi-Fi Audio Systems with the problems of always needing an AUX cord connected to the phone or getting up to change the song manually.

With SoundPi you can leave some work up to your Raspberry Pi, like:

- Keeping your songs in an organized database
- Organizing your albums, songs and playlists
- Keeping track of your or your family’s favorite songs and playlists


## Usage
Using SoundPi is just a URL away!
Get your phone or any device that has a browser and a wifi connection and go to your Pi local IP (192.168.1.xx).
