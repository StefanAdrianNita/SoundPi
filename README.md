# SoundPi
 _With the help of a RaspberryPI you can make your Audio Hi-FI System Smart!_

## Description
This project was born to help people with old Hi-Fi Audio Systems with the problem of always needing an AUX cord connected to the phone or to always get up and go to the system to change the song.

With SoundPi you can leave the work to your Raspberry Pi for:

- Keeping your songs in memory
- Organize your albums
- Keep track of your or your family favorite songs and playlists

## Installation
