 _With the help of a RaspberryPi you can make your Audio Hi-FI System Smart!_

## Description
This project was born to help people with old Hi-Fi Audio Systems with the problems of always needing an AUX cord connected to the phone or getting up to change the song manually.

With SoundPi you can leave some work up to your Raspberry Pi, like:

- Keeping your songs in an organized database
- Organizing your albums, songs and playlists
- Keeping track of your or your family’s favorite songs and playlists

## Installation

_Work in progress_
At the moment there isn't any type of installer for this project, stay tuned for updates!

## Usage
Using SoundPi is just a URL away!
Get your phone or any device that has a browser and a wifi connection and go to your Pi local IP (192.168.1.xx).
